# Simple DEX
This is a simple DEX modeled off of Uniswap V2. It is from a class project for the Stanford class, CS251: "Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies". The contracts folder contains two contracts. The first, token.sol, is a contract for a generic ERC-20 token. The second, exchange.sol, is the contract for the DEX. Exchange.js interacts with the contracts. 

The rest of the files were provided by the teaching staff for this course, Dan Boneh, Mathew Hogan '22 and Simon Tao '22.
